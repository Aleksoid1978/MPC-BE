Part A: Preparing the Visual Studio 2017 environment

 Visual Studio 2017
  1. Install Visual Studio 2017 v15.5.7 or later (any edition will work fine). During installation, you must select the following components: 
   * Desktop development with C++
     * VC++ 2017 v141 toolset
     * Visual C++ ATL support
     * MFC and ATL support
     * Windows 8.1 SDK".

  Download URL: http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs

Part B: Preparing the GCC environment
 NOTES:
  * If you installed the MSYS/MinGW package in an other directory you will have to use that path in the following steps.

 1. Download and extract "MSYS_MinGW-w64_GCC_730_x86-x64.7z" to "C:\MSYS" -> http://mpc-be.org/MSYS/MSYS_MinGW-w64_GCC_730_x86-x64.7z
 2. Create a file named "environments.bat" in "C:\mpc-be\" containing the following entries:
    @ECHO OFF
    SET "MPCBE_MSYS=C:\MSYS"
    SET "MPCBE_MINGW=C:\MSYS\mingw"
 3. Optional, if you want to customize the Windows SDK version used, add the following environment variable (in System Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables):
    Variable          Value
    MPCBE_WINSDK_VER  8.1

Part C: Downloading and compiling the MPC-BE source

1. Use a subversion client to checkout MPC-BE's trunk to "C:\mpc-be" (or anywhere else you like)
    Repository URL: svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mpcbe/code/trunk 
    The recommended SVN client is TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html)
2. When using TortoiseSVN
    a) Create an empty directory where you want to store the source files. e.g: C:\mpc-be
    b) Right-click on that directory and choose "SVN checkout".
    c) Put svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mpcbe/code/trunk in "URL of Repository" and press OK.
    d) Wait for the source tree to be downloaded.

3. Open folder "C:\mpc-be\"
   Execute the batch file update_gcc.bat (it is necessary to do to copy the files libgcc.a and libmingwex.a, in the folders "lib" and "lib64")
4. Open the solution file: C:\mpc-be\mpc-be.sln 
   Change the solution's configuration to "Release" (in the toolbar).

5. Press OK to save the changes and close the Properties window.
6. Press F7 to build the solution.
7. You now have mpc-be.exe under C:\mpc-be\bin\mpc-be_x86
8. Open the solution file C:\mpc-be\mpciconlib.sln
9. Press F7 to build the solution.
10. You now have mpciconlib.dll under C:\mpc-be\bin\mpc-be_x86
11. Open the solution file C:\mpc-be\mpcresources.sln
    In Visual Studio go to Build->Batch Build->Press Select All->Press Build
12. You now have mpcresources.XX.dll under C:\mpc-be\bin\mpc-be_x86\Lang

Alternatively, you can use build.bat (run: build.bat help for more info)


Part D: Building the installer

Download Inno Setup Unicode v5.5.9 or newer from: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Download Inno Download Plugin from: https://bitbucket.org/mitrich_k/inno-download-plugin/downloads
Install everything and then go to C:\mpc-be\distrib, open mpc-be_setup.iss with Inno Setup, read the first comments in the script and compile it.
Note: Use Inno Setup's built-in IDE.
